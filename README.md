# distribution-modelling-uio-2025
Materials for the course "BIOS5211 / BIOS9211 â€“ Distribution Modelling" at the University of Oslo (UiO). This course provides an introduction to distribution modelling and data processing and analytical tools used in this field. 

0. Please go through the short presentation on what is Git and GitHub [here](https://github.com/geco-nhm/distribution-modelling-uio-2025/blob/main/additional_materials/git_version_control/git_github_overview_LK_PH.pdf)

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your machine. Check out [this](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) small tutorial on how to clone. You can do this either by the command line or through the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application  
2. Get familiar with the folder structure
3. Download spatial data before the first lab through the link [here](https://uio-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/peterhor_uio_no/EXZrawRTxcNNucTHKkUf-FIBqanCux8Vd_jGHW767Xd0KA?e=FYfsa0)

4. After you have downloaded the spatial data (12 raster files in TIF format), move the files into the prepared folder **distribution-modelling-uio-2025/lab_data** of your local copy of the github repository and place them there in a folder you create called RASTER.
5. New files will become available after lab exercises. [Check for changes](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/getting-changes-from-a-remote-repository) to this repository by *git -fetch* in the command line or *fetch origin* in the Desktop version
