# We also evaluate model fit in terms of predictive power based on two-fold cross-validation.
# Doing the latter takes a lot of time, as the model needs to be re-fitted twice. For this reason,
# we store the results from cross-validation.
# Set run.cross.validation = TRUE to perform the cross-validation and to save the results.
# Set run.cross.validation = FALSE to read in results from cross-validation that you have run previously.

# We observe that (with thin = 1) the average (over the species) AUC for explanatory power is 0.88,
# and  the average AUC for predictive power is 0.79.
# The average TjurR2 for explanatory power is 0.42,
# and  the average TjurR2  for predictive power is 0.31.
# These results are expected in the sense that explanatory power is typically higher than predictive power,
# and that AUC and TjurR2 are based on different units, AUC being typically higher.
# See the book for more explanation of both of these topics!

# While the code above yields the average results over the species, we may also look at the species-specific results.
# For example, let us plot the explanatory and predictive AUC measures with respect to each other.

plot(MF$AUC,MFCV$AUC)
abline(0,1)

# The call to abline(0,1) adds the identity line (y=x) to the plot. For points (=species) below the line,
# explanatory power is greater than predictive power.

# If we would have fitted multiple models, we could compare them either based on the cross-validation
# (as was done by above) or with WAIC. WAIC can be computed as follows:

WAIC = computeWAIC(m)
WAIC

# As we fitted only one model, WAIC is not informative, as the absolute value is not relevant, just a comparison between models
